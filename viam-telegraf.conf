# Read metrics about cpu usage
[[inputs.cpu]]
  ## Whether to report per-cpu stats or not
  percpu = false
  ## Whether to report total system cpu stats or not
  totalcpu = true
  ## If true, collect raw CPU time metrics
  collect_cpu_time = false
  ## If true, compute and report the sum of all non-idle CPU states
  ## NOTE: The resulting 'time_active' field INCLUDES 'iowait'!
  report_active = false
  ## If true and the info is available then add core_id and physical_id tags
  core_tags = false


# Read metrics about disk usage by mount point
[[inputs.disk]]
  ## By default stats will be gathered for all mount points.
  ## Set mount_points will restrict the stats to only the specified mount points.
  # mount_points = ["/"]

  ## Ignore mount points by filesystem type.
  ignore_fs = ["tmpfs", "devtmpfs", "devfs", "iso9660", "overlay", "aufs", "squashfs"]

  ## Ignore mount points by mount options.
  ## The 'mount' command reports options of all mounts in parathesis.
  ## Bind mounts can be ignored with the special 'bind' option.
  # ignore_mount_opts = []


# Read metrics about disk IO by device
[[inputs.diskio]]
  ## By default, telegraf will gather stats for all devices including
  ## disk partitions.
  ## Setting devices will restrict the stats to the specified devices.
  ## NOTE: Globbing expressions (e.g. asterix) are not supported for
  ##       disk synonyms like '/dev/disk/by-id'.
  # devices = ["sda", "sdb", "vd*", "/dev/disk/by-id/nvme-eui.00123deadc0de123"]
  ## Uncomment the following line if you need disk serial numbers.
  # skip_serial_number = false
  #
  ## On systems which support it, device metadata can be added in the form of
  ## tags.
  ## Currently only Linux is supported via udev properties. You can view
  ## available properties for a device by running:
  ## 'udevadm info -q property -n /dev/sda'
  ## Note: Most, but not all, udev properties can be accessed this way. Properties
  ## that are currently inaccessible include DEVTYPE, DEVNAME, and DEVPATH.
  # device_tags = ["ID_FS_TYPE", "ID_FS_USAGE"]
  #
  ## Using the same metadata source as device_tags, you can also customize the
  ## name of the device via templates.
  ## The 'name_templates' parameter is a list of templates to try and apply to
  ## the device. The template may contain variables in the form of '$PROPERTY' or
  ## '${PROPERTY}'. The first template which does not contain any variables not
  ## present for the device is used as the device name tag.
  ## The typical use case is for LVM volumes, to get the VG/LV name instead of
  ## the near-meaningless DM-0 name.
  # name_templates = ["$ID_FS_LABEL","$DM_VG_NAME/$DM_LV_NAME"]


# Plugin to collect various Linux kernel statistics.
# This plugin ONLY supports Linux

  ## Additional gather options
  ## Possible options include:
  ## * ksm - kernel same-page merging

# Read metrics about memory usage
[[inputs.mem]]
  # no configuration


# Get the number of processes and group them by status
# This plugin ONLY supports non-Windows
[[inputs.processes]]
  ## Use sudo to run ps command on *BSD systems. Linux systems will read
  ## /proc, so this does not apply there.
  # use_sudo = false


# Read metrics about swap memory usage
# This plugin ONLY supports Linux
[[inputs.swap]]
  # no configuration


# Read metrics about system load & uptime
[[inputs.system]]
  # no configuration


# Gather metrics about network interfaces
[[inputs.net]]
  ## By default, telegraf gathers stats from any up interface (excluding loopback)
  ## Setting interfaces will tell it to gather these explicit interfaces,
  ## regardless of status. When specifying an interface, glob-style
  ## patterns are also supported.
  ##
  # interfaces = ["eth*", "enp0s[0-1]", "lo"]
  ##
  ## On linux systems telegraf also collects protocol stats.
  ## Setting ignore_protocol_stats to true will skip reporting of protocol metrics.
  ##
  ## DEPRECATION NOTICE: A value of 'false' is deprecated and discouraged!
  ##                     Please set this to `true` and use the 'inputs.nstat'
  ##                     plugin instead.

  ## Sets 'proc' directory path
  ## If not specified, then default is /proc
